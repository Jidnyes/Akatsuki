# Nagar-Smriti – Borivali Civic Accountability Platform

Nagar-Smriti is a modern, web-based civic grievance and accountability platform designed specifically for Borivali East and Borivali West, Mumbai.  
Unlike traditional complaint systems, Nagar-Smriti focuses on **civic memory, public pressure, transparency, and time-based accountability**, ensuring that issues are not just reported but remembered, tracked, and resolved responsibly.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

Most civic platforms stop at complaint submission.  
**Nagar-Smriti goes further** by introducing the concept of *city memory* — where every location remembers its past issues, repair history, and resolution timelines.

The platform demonstrates how technology can improve trust between citizens and municipal authorities through clear visibility and accountability.
